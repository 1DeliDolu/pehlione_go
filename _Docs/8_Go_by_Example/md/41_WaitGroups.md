Go by Example: WaitGroups
To wait for multiple goroutines to finish, we can use a wait group.

Run codeCopy code
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)
This is the function we’ll run in every goroutine.

func worker(id int) {
    fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)
Sleep to simulate an expensive task.

    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}
func main() {
This WaitGroup is used to wait for all the goroutines launched here to finish. Note: if a WaitGroup is explicitly passed into functions, it should be done by pointer.

    var wg sync.WaitGroup
Launch several goroutines using WaitGroup.Go

    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        wg.Go(func() {
            worker(i)
        })
    }
Block until all the goroutines started by wg are done. A goroutine is done when the function it invokes returns.

    wg.Wait()
Note that this approach has no straightforward way to propagate errors from workers. For more advanced use cases, consider using the errgroup package.

}
$ go run waitgroups.go
Worker 5 starting
Worker 3 starting
Worker 4 starting
Worker 1 starting
Worker 2 starting
Worker 4 done
Worker 1 done
Worker 2 done
Worker 5 done
Worker 3 done
The order of workers starting up and finishing is likely to be different for each invocation.
